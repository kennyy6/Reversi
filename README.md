# Reversi
One of my first coding projects in 2019, although the logic behind the game is appalling.
I left it as it is to compare to my future endeavours but i also  implement a gui for it as it was originally a text based.

Future Plans/Improvements:

* Documentation
* add single player
* Utlize a min-max algorithm
* ability to restart from the get-go
