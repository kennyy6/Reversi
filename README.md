# Reversi
One of my first coding projects in 2019 for uni, although the logic behind the game is appalling.
Note that I was unable to use any imports and methods that made this task significantly easier.
I left it as it is to compare to my future progression but i also  implemented a gui for it as it was originally a console based.


Future Plans/Improvements:

* Documentation for the gui section
* adds single player
  * Utlize a min-max algorithm
* ability to restart from the get-go
